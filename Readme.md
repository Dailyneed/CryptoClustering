# Cryptocurrency Clustering

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to the knowledge of Python and Unsupervised machine learning to predict if cryptocurriences are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Technologies
Python, 
Sklearn, 
Jupyter notebook, 
Pandas


## Instruction:
Use the standardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file.
Create a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id index from the the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.
Use the elbow method to find the best value for k.
Cluster cryptocurrencies with K-means using the original scaled data.
Optimize clusters with prinicipal component analysis.
Find the best value for k using the PCA data.
Cluster cryptocurriencies with k-means using the PCA data..
Visualize and compare the results.
